# Sumo-Balls

As the name suggest the point of the game is to knock out balls from the platform.

Player Uses WASD to move and rotate the camera.

There are a few different enemy balls, 3 different bosses and 3 different power-ups.

With each enemy wave cleared the number of enemies increses by 1 and a random power-up spawns.
On every 3 enemy wave cleared a random boss spawns.

The power-up are
- super knock back strength if enemies touch you
- jump AOE pushback
- homing rockets (3 per enemy)

What Bosses do:
- Once changes color to gold indicating that it will attract the player like a magnet when they are close
- One is fast and has great handling
- The third one is slow, heavy and spawns a random smaller enemy every few seconds, and for every 3 enemies it spawn it also spawns a random power-up
